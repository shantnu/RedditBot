You will need to have sqlite3 installed, generally it's something like this:

    #sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

You may find it useful to be able to visualize your sqlite db, you can use the following Firefox 
add-on to interact with sqlite:

I highly reccomend building your projects using a venv or virtaulenv. 
If you are not familiar with venv go read about it and come back with an activated venv ;)
