 
https://github.com/shantnu/RedditBot served as a basic template for what I've provided here.
If you have questions regarding the setup you can just 'cd ..' ;)

You will need to have sqlite3 installed, generally it's something like this:

    #sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

You may find it useful to be able to visualize your sqlite db, you can use the following Firefox 
add-on to interact with sqlite:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/

I highly reccomend building your projects using a venv or virtaulenv. 
If you are not familiar with venv go read about it and come back with an activated venv ;)

As always, review all the code before running.

START

You'll want to do the sql bit first. You can run bot.sql with sqlite3, there are instructions in the commments.
If learning is your goal I reccomend using bot.sql as a template, and creating your tables manually
in the sqlite3 cli.

posts.py should be run 2nd, it will add the Reddit post data to your db.

bot.py creates a response from the 'posts' table, and checks if you have responded to the current post in the past. If not it posts
the new comment and adds a record of it to the 'replied_to' table. If you want to run it as a cronjob make sure to add a shebang.
