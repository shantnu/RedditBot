            <h1>How to Use</h1>
            <p>Simply use any on of the supported sub reddits and write "#skilledaf" when describing a post in either the title or main body of one of your own posts, or in a toplevel comment of a rising post that you believe has earned the praise. Our bot
                will then see it as it scans and add the link and basic info to our file, and thats that. Now you have begun to help us log all that reddit finds to be #skilledaf.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Please note that some posts might slip through the cracks as balancing the limited request that reddit allows for these bots and the massive amout of information that needs to be sifted through can be quit dificult.</p>

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We are a small group of undergraduate students in a North East US school looking to make a name for urselfes. It started with us trying to flip this and other domains we had baught. In order to try and generatre traffic to them we figured
                why not make a relavent app to park there... and the the reddit hashtag project was born. </p>
